**Project Objective and Scope**
This project involves building a machine-learning model that can learn from a chosen past stock
price. The model will predict the next day's closing price of
the stock.


From this prediction, the trend of the stock in question, will be derived.
Evaluation metrics will be used to derive the model’s performance on its prediction.
Motivation: Stock price changes are caused by very complex technical factors and often involve a
degree of market sentiment (Smith, 2023). Furthermore, there are other complex, non-
quantifiable factors to consider, such as the political climate of the time.
Combined, these factors make predicting future stock prices inherently very difficult to
accomplish.


Herein lies my motivation; to explore if my model and overall project can add value to the arsenal
of tools available to stock traders.


***Goal:***
This project aims to explore and develop a machine-learning model that predicts the next
day’s closing price of a stock. Additionally, based on the prediction, the trend (up, down, or flat)
will be derived, delivering supplemental insights to inform investment decisions.
Relevance: Due to the complexity and volatility of the stock markets, the project aims to provide
further data-driven insights to supplement the analysis available in most stock trading platforms.


***Objectives:***
o Achieve a minimum of 65% accuracy on a diversified test set.
o Provide prediction on the next day's closing price of a stock.
o Derive trend from the predicted closing price.
o Provide evaluation metrics and explanation.


***Approach:***
Throughout this overview, the term “iterative model development with refinements” is used. The
project proposal also references this.
To level set, this means that during this project, I first did an initial pass through all the steps of
data acquisition, analysis, preparation cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation
using key metrics. After this initial step, I continuously went back and tweaked elements from the
different steps above and ran through the process again, each time comparing those key metrics.
Suffice to say that the first several attempts yielded subpar results. However, I was able to learn
and expose different areas of improvement leading to the optimization of my final model.
In all those instances that I refer to “'iterative model development with refinements”, this is what I
am implying.
